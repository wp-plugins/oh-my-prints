Connect a post or page to an object for sale on www.ohmyprints.com or www.werkaandemuur.nl as it's known in the Netherlands

== Description ==
Connect a post or page to an object for sale on www.ohmyprints.com / www.werkaandemuur.nl
If a work is not for sale it points to your shop.

Clicks on the shop/photo link are counted and shown as a column in the page/posts overview so you can see how many users clicked on 
the link. 

After installing this plugin you have to put the widget on the pages with sellable photo's, paintings and the like.
In the page or posts on the photo you will find a field to save the artcode. Pages with an artcode het the "for sale" texts
as given in the widget settings. All other photo's get the description.
In the description you can use an <a %s>... </a> for the link to the ohmyprint site. As this link works through an ajax call there are
some attributes needed and all those are filled in on the %s spot. After clicking the page is loaded in a new tab/window.

in the posts and pages overview there will be a column "sale clicks" which shows the number of times the widget is clicked. 
If the "for sale" link was followed on an photo which is not for sale an '*' is added to the counter.

Btw. This plugin has no connection with the company behind "Oh My Print" or "Werk aan de muur". They don't have an api or any programmer support and this 
plugin basically just redirects your users to the right page. To bad for the lack of api, I would love to show some real statistics.. 

Since version 1.1 there's also a shortcode to use:

[ohmyprints]This photo is for sale! <a %s>Click here</a> to go to the sales page.[/ohmyprints]

The text will only be shown when there's an artcode for the page. The <a %s> will be changed into an link with the right info as needed.

I use this widget together with WooSidebars (https://wordpress.org/plugins/woosidebars/) so I can easy controle where the widget ends up.. 
The WooSidebars widget isn't tested for 4.1 but works without problems for me. 
In my case it's only loaded for photo's in the "for sale" category.

you can force which language to use. The default is "site language" which works as before. The alternatives are NL, EN, DE and FR.

* added shortcode
